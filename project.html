							<p>
									In this article the progress of robotics research is shown 
									in the last half century as a response to the evolution of human social needs,
									from the industrial robotics that released the human operator from  risky tasks 
									to the recent burst of field and service robotics to assist the human. 
									Robotics contracts with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots,
									as well as computer systems for their control and information processing.
									These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for
									humans and replicate human actions.The new ideas in robotics research have
									been designate service robotics because of their goal of getting robots closer 
									to human  and this article surveys research on facility robotics such as medical 
									robotics, rehabilitation robotics, underwater robotics, field robotics, construction
									robotics and humanoid robotics.

							<b class="p-1 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">INDUSTRIAL ROBOT:</b>
							<p>
									Approximately in 1960 when industrial robots were first introduced in the
									production process, and until the 1990s industrial robots conquered robotics
									research. When it is established, the automotive industry dictated the 
									specifications industrial robots had to meet, mainly due to the industryâ€™s
									market clout and clear technical necessities. These necessities determined
									which areas of investigation were predominant during that period.
									One such area was kinematic calibration, which is a necessary process
									due to the inaccuracy of kinematic models based on manufacturing parameters.
									The calibration process is carried out in four stages. The first stage 
									is mathematical modeling,where the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) method and
									the product-of-exponential (POE) formulation lead the large family 
									of methods.

							<b class="p-1 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">UNDERWATER ROBOT:</b>
							<p>
									Addition to that 70% of the earth is covered by ocean. However,
									little effort has been made to exploit or protect this vast resource,
									compared to space or terrestrial programs.During the last few years,
									the use of underwater robotic vehicles has rapidly increased, since such
									vehicles can be operated in the deeper, riskier areas that divers cannot reach.
									The potential applications of such vehicles include fishing, underwater 
									pollution monitoring, rescue, and waste cleaning and handling in the 
									ocean as well as at nuclear sites. Most commercial unmanned underwater
									robots are tethered and remotely operated; they are as a group, referred
									to as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).

							<b class="p-1 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">CONCLUSION:</b>
							<p>
									In the introduction of industrial robots in the automotive industry, 
									robotics research has evolved over time towards the development of
									robotic systems to help the human in dangerous,risky or unpleasant tasks. 
									As the complexity of tasks has increased,flexibility has been demanded in
									industrial robots, and robotics research has veered towards adaptive and
									intelligent systems.Since 1995, robotics research has entered the field-
									and service-robotics world, where we can find manipulators, mobile robots
									and animal-like robots with great perspectives of development and increasing 
									research interest. Robots  such as surgical robots have been the first successes,
									and recently different areas in medicaland rehabilitation-robotics applications
									have arisen.

							<b class="p-1 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">ABSTRACT</b>
							<p>
									ONLINE FOOD ORDER SYSTEM is mainly designed primarily function 
									for use in the food delivery industry. This system will allow hotels
									and restaurants to increase online food ordering such type of business.
									The customers can be selected food menu items just few minutes.
									In the modern food industries allows to quickly and easily delivery 
									on customer place. Restaurant employees then use these orders through 
									an easy to delivery on customer place easy find out navigate graphical 
									interface for efficient processing.

							<p class="text-center mt-1"><b>Image Name:Online food ordering System</b></p>
					
					
							<b class="p-1 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">INTRODUCTION</b>
							<p>
									In restaurant-controlled online food ordering, the restaurants create 
									their own website and app, or choose to hire a delivery vendor. If they 
									choose to create their own website, they make sure to obtain software that 
									manages the orders efficiently, meaning it has the capability to manage
									different orders at once.When they hire a vendor, the restaurant pays 
									for a monthly fee or percentage-based fees. The vendor covers the developmental costs.
									A customer can choose to have the food delivered or for pick-up. The process consists 
									of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, scanning the menu items,
									choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery.Payment is then 
									administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website
									or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup.The website and app
									inform the customer of the food quality, duration of food preparation,
									and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery.

							<b class="p-1 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white">WORKING</b>
							<p>
									Your customer places a food order on your website or Facebook page.
									The order is instantly pushed to your smartphone or tablet where you 
									can review it via the free order taking app we provide.
									You decide the pickup time/delivery time and your answer is pushed
									right away, which makes the entire process short and effective.
									You start cooking and can come back to the order taking app anytime to 
									see past or any pending orders.
